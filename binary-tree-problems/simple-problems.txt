1.Check if an array represents Inorder of Binary Search tree or not

soln : check if the array is sorted or not

2.Find the second largest element in a BST

soln : inorder traversal of the array generates the sorted order and from there find the element before the last element

3.Check if two BSTs contain same set of elements

soln : inorder traverse the two bsts to generate sorted arrays.then check if the two arrays are same in size or not.if not same then return false
       else loop to the size and check that if the corresponding elements of the arrays are same ....if all the elements match return true;


4.Print all the nodes between 2 levels in a Binary tree

soln : traverse the tree levelwise and for each level check if that level is >= low_level && level <= high_level
       if true print the nodes
